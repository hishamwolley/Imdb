## Details to re-edit moving fwd

Sorting was only done between movies & tv shows.

Sidebar categories still need to be created & configured.

Search styling not complete, inline styling applied. ( need to update searchresults from div to select element for better ui experience )

Mobile view searchbar still not functional

Add tmdb guest session to local storage ( for each rating a new guest session is being generated )

rating notification is inline style + need to create redux state for api calls to adjust rating notification message if api req failed
